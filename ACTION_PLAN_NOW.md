## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Save all URLs** - Write down backend URL, frontend URL
2. **Test each phase** - Don't move to next phase until current one works
3. **Read the errors** - They tell you what's wrong
4. **Check the logs** - Render and Vercel show detailed logs
5. **Be patient** - First deployment takes longer (5-10 min)
6. **Don't close browser tabs** - You'll need info from them later
